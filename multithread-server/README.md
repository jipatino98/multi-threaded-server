For this assignment, I used the helper functions that were given to us. I also utilized the approach that Mitchell suggested in office hours, which was to apply a temporary lock right before we flock() the URI and releasing it right after. I also recieved guidance from Mitchell's office hour regarding parsing the command line and initializing the threads before they worked on requests from the queue.
